# Conclusion 

1. We created a data table to show the difference in the total 3 Point Shots made and attempted, before and after Stephen Curry joined the league. Being most notable for his shooting abilities and his capabilities in leading the NBA league for the most number of 3 Point Shots made, the amount of shots made and attempted doubled after Stephen Curry. 

2. The data labeled "Steph Curry Effect"" shows the before and after Stephen joined the league, doubling the percentage of the Shots Made before he joined. 

3. However, although Steph Curry was notorious for his abilities, we find that the Shot percentage was relatively the same before and after his arrival in the league. Although the average shots made increased after his adjoining, we also find that the shots attempted after his arrival had been doubled compared to the shots attempted before. 

4. While researching this data, we found that the dataset **was** of reasonable quality; showing data from the year 2000 all the way to the year 2020. I believe it did give unbiased results; answering the questions to how impactful Stephen Curry was in the league. The data we analyzed does not harm any particular groups of population, as it solely just shows the data of 3 Point shots made/attempted.

5. In the future, when working on advancing this project, we would like to grab data on years starting from when the NBA first started, all the way to the present; including data from every game that was played to get results based off of every game in the NBA. We could also sort the data so that it shows the impact Stephen Curry had sorted out by positions, to also get more accurate results.
