## The Data

The data for this project contains individual player stats in the NBA from the year 2000 to 2020. Using the website https://www.basketball-reference.com/ NBA player stats are converted and downloaded as a csv file for each year. The 20 files were then cleaned, formatted, and combined into one huge data set that contains all NBA player stats from year 2000 to 2020.

The variables in the data sets are:

	* Player: name of the NBA player
	* Pos: position of that player on their team
	* X3P: 3 point made
	* X3PA: 3 point attempted
	* X3P.: 3 point percentage (X3P/X3PA)
	* Year: year the data was from
